## What changed

<!-- What it does and how it works. Call out anything non-obvious in the diff. -->

## Memory footprint

<!-- Required. Under 100 MB always, and back to baseline after the palette closes.
     Use `vmmap -summary <pid>` Physical footprint — not Activity Monitor, not `ps` RSS.
     Recipe: docs/testing.md § Memory footprint. -->

Leak-tested:

## Demo

<!-- Visual change → side-by-side before/after video. Same window size, same actions.
     "After"-only clips and stills don't count. Delete this section if nothing visual changed. -->

## Drawbacks

<!-- Tradeoffs made on purpose, and anything you're unsure about. "None" is a valid answer. -->

## Tests & validation

<!-- Which Tests/ harnesses you ran and any cases you added, plus what you exercised by hand.
     Commands: docs/development.md § Tests. -->
