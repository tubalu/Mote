# Testing and verification

How to check that a change holds up. Mote has no XCTest target and no UI tests: the automated half
is a set of standalone harnesses, and the manual half is the sweep at the bottom of this file.

## Definition of done

The mechanical bar, in one place so it cannot drift. All five pass before a change is finished.

| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| The harnesses | `./Scripts/run-tests.sh` |
| Lint | `./Scripts/lint.sh` |
| Pure-layer purity | `grep -rln 'import AppKit\|import SwiftUI\|import Cocoa' Mote/Features/*/Model/` |
| A clean build | `xcodebuild … -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, zero **new** warnings |
| Docs still true | any doc your change made wrong, fixed in the same commit |

CI runs the first two and does not build the app at all — so the build, the purity grep and the docs
are on you. Each is expanded below; the manual sweep at the end of this file is the sixth, judged by
what you touched.

## The harnesses

```sh
./Scripts/run-tests.sh              # all of them
./Scripts/run-tests.sh calc-test    # just one, while iterating
```

The script is the **only** place the harness set is written down — CI runs exactly this, so the two
cannot drift. Adding a harness means adding one `run` line.

Each harness compiles the **shipped sources** it guards rather than a copy of them, which is what makes
the pure-layer boundary real: a harness that stops *compiling* means AppKit or SwiftUI has leaked into a
`Model/` folder, or an effect has leaked into a decision. That is a more common failure than a broken
assertion, and it is the more important one.

A harness also runs in your own login session against the real system, with no sandbox and no fixture
world, so it must never mutate state the machine shares with the apps you use.

Never join a compile to its run with `&&` in a `set -e` script. `set -e` is specified to ignore a
failing command in a non-final AND-OR list member, so `swiftc … && /tmp/x` swallows a compile error and
the script sails on. CI reported success over a harness that had not compiled for twenty-five phases
because of exactly this; `run-tests.sh` keeps the two steps separate and records both kinds of failure.

### What to run when

If a change touches anything in the right column, the harness on the left is mandatory.

| Harness | Guards |
| --- | --- |
| `fuzz-test` | `Launcher/Model/SearchRelevance.swift` |
| `ranking-test` | `Launcher/Model/LauncherRankingStore.swift` |
| `scopes-test` | `Launcher/Model/SearchScopes.swift` |
| `app-name-test` | `Platform/AppDisplayName.swift` — every path that names a scanned bundle |
| `favorites-test` | `Launcher/Model/FavoriteSlots.swift` |
| `palette-selection-test` | `Features/PaletteRowIndex.swift` |
| `palette-placement-test` | `DesignSystem/Theme.swift`, `Palette/PalettePlacement.swift` |
| `hover-arming-test` | `Palette/HoverArming.swift`, `PaletteState`, `PaletteMode` |
| `palette-escape-test` | `Palette/PaletteEscapeAction.swift` |
| `hotkey-test` | `HotKeys/Model/DoubleTapModifier.swift`, `DoubleTapDetector.swift`, `HyperKey.swift`, `HotKeyAction.swift`, `Service/KeyShortcut.swift`, and the command→action mapping in `Launcher/Model/CommandID.swift` |
| `callout-test` | `DesignSystem/Theme.swift`, `HotKeys/UI/CalloutPlacement.swift` |
| `icon-cache-test` | `Platform/Images/IconCache.swift` |
| `entry-icon-test` | `EntryIcon` — that each case draws, caches and prints apart from the others |
| `system-action-test` | `SystemActions/Model/SystemAction.swift` |
| `volume-test` | `SystemActions/Model/VolumeLevel.swift` |
| `settings-history-test` | `Settings/SettingsTab.swift`, `SettingsHistory.swift` |
| `appearance-test` | `Platform/Appearance.swift`, `DesignSystem/Theme.swift`, `AppAppearance` |
| `scroll-reveal-test` | `DesignSystem/Scrolling/SelectionReveal.swift` |

A harness that passed before a change passes after it. There is no "I'll fix it next commit" and no
commenting out a case. If a change genuinely invalidates an assertion, the assertion is rewritten in the
same commit with the reason in the message.

### Purity checks

The layering rule reduces to one grep, and it must return nothing:

```sh
grep -rln 'import AppKit\|import SwiftUI\|import Cocoa' Mote/Features/*/Model/
```

Beyond the imports, the injected-environment half is not mechanically checkable, so it is worth an eye
when touching a pure file:

- `HotKeys/Model/DoubleTap*` still take the clock as a parameter
- `Features/PaletteRowIndex.swift` still imports Foundation alone, despite living under `Features/`

## Build and size checks

A clean build is part of the bar; CI does not build the app, so this is on you.

```sh
xcodegen generate                 # only after editing project.yml
xcodebuild build -project Mote.xcodeproj -scheme Mote -configuration Debug \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
xcodebuild build -project Mote.xcodeproj -scheme Mote -configuration Release \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "Mote*.app" -maxdepth 6 -print -quit
```

- Zero **new** warnings. Pre-existing ones are not your problem; new ones are.
- No `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)` or `assumeIsolated` added without a stated reason.
- The type-checker did not time out. `LauncherList.rows` already carries an explicit annotation for
  this reason; the fix for a timeout is an annotation, not a restructure.
- Release binary under **4 MB**, and under 2% growth for an ordinary change.

### Lint

```sh
./Scripts/lint.sh
```

SwiftLint owns the rules that catch defects, including the two checkable comment rules — the
100-character cap and the ban on stacked comment lines. Errors block; warnings do not. There is no
formatter, deliberately — the configuration and the measurements behind that are in
[development.md](development.md#formatting).

## Performance measurement

`Platform/Signposts.swift` emits eight intervals on the `com.mote.perf` subsystem: `AppCore.start`,
`AppIndex.scan`, `AppIndex.rank`, `PaletteWindowController.show`, `UninstallScanner.discover` and
`UninstallScanner.measure`, `FileSearchService.search`, and `Notes.search`. Open the Time Profiler or
`os_signpost` instrument in Instruments and filter to that subsystem; nothing needs recompiling.

Run the real Spotlight-backed file-search benchmark separately from the deterministic harnesses:

```sh
swiftc -O -swift-version 6 Mote/Platform/Signposts.swift \
    Mote/Features/Launcher/Model/SearchRelevance.swift \
    Mote/Features/FileSearch/Model/*.swift \
    Mote/Features/FileSearch/Service/FileSearchService.swift \
    Tests/file-search-performance.swift -o /tmp/file-search-performance
/tmp/file-search-performance
```

Every query runs twice: once on the shipped rules and once with five extra user patterns, so the output
says what the ignore list itself costs rather than only what Spotlight does.

`Signposts.interval` owns an explicit `defer` around the wrapped work on purpose. The obvious spelling
leaks the interval when the work throws, because the `.end` emit is skipped on the throw path and the
instrument then shows an interval that never closes.

Measure before optimising, and measure the same way twice. For cold launch: quit fully, relaunch, time
it three times, take the median.

### Recorded baselines

Measured at the end of the 2026 refactor, on `main`. Useful as orders of magnitude, not as contracts.

| | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Release binary | 3,655,736 B (from 3,471,592 B at the start of the refactor) |
| Resident memory | 40–80 MB in normal use; the hard ceiling is 100 MB |
| `SpotlightNames` cache | 76 ms cold, 0.2 ms warm |
| `SettingsPaneScanner` warm scan | 0.014 ms (16.5 ms cold), 52 panes |
| Largest view / owner | `RootPaletteView` 662 lines, `AppCore` 284 lines |
| Comment density | 1,653 of 27,289 source lines (6.1%) |
| `palette-selection-test` | 111,684 assertions — a tripwire: a change in this count means the row-order model moved |
| `SnippetKeywordPolicy` match | 7 µs/keystroke at 50 keywords, 59 µs at 1,000 — the `lowercased()` is 0.09 µs of it |
| `ClipboardStore.pinnedItems` | 27–127 µs per uncached search, 1,000-row window — no cache earns its invalidation yet |
| `count items of trash` | 5,000 ms against a cold Finder on an *empty* Trash, 110 ms warm — why AppleScript is detached |

Launch time, allocation counts and RSS have never been captured as numbers. The signposts are in place,
so any of them can be taken from `main` whenever a change makes it worth knowing.

## Manual regression sweep

There is no UI test suite, so this is it. Run the core sweep for any change that touches the palette;
run the scoped section for whatever feature you touched. Budget about five minutes plus three per
section.

Run against the **Debug channel** (`Mote Dev.app`, `com.mote.app.dev`). It has its own prefs,
caches, TCC grants and login item, so this cannot disturb an installed copy.

### Core

- Palette hotkey opens the launcher; pressing it again closes it; Escape clears a non-empty query,
  then hides on a second press; clicking away closes it
- Reopening focuses the search field with an empty query, in the same position and at the same size
- Compact mode: typing expands it, and the search bar does **not** shift vertically during the swap
- With a CJK IME: the placeholder clears as soon as composition starts and the composing text never
  overlaps it; cancelling composition brings the placeholder back, and the list filters only once the
  candidate is committed — check on a second summon too, where first responder never moved
- Typing filters instantly; ↑/↓ move the highlight and scroll it into view without yanking the list
- ⌃N/⌃P move the highlight as ↓/↑ do; ⌃F/⌃B step the emoji grid's selection, and the caret elsewhere
- The highlight always sits on the row the footer pill describes
- With a calculation typed, the calculator card is first and is selected first
- Section headers appear in order: Favorites, Applications, System Settings, Quicklinks, Snippets,
  System Actions, Window Management, Custom Commands, Commands
- ⌘K opens the Actions menu; ↑/↓ move it, ↵ activates, Escape closes the menu rather than the palette
- While a menu is open, typing does **not** change the query and the caret is hidden
- Tab toggles launcher ↔ clipboard; bare Backspace on an empty query backs out of a sub-screen
- Launching an app focuses it; escaping the palette returns focus to the app you came from
- Paste from clipboard history lands in that app, not in Mote
- No flash, flicker or reflow on open, and row metrics unchanged

### Clipboard

- A copy appears at the top within about a second; an image copy records a thumbnail
- Search is correct both under and over three characters
- ⌘. pins and the highlight follows the row into Pinned; ⌘⌫ deletes; ⌘↵ copies without pasting
- ⌃X deletes the selected entry and ⌃⇧X clears the history, from the list and from an open ⌘K menu
- ⌃⇧X asks first, through Mote's own dialog; Cancel and Esc both leave every entry in place
- ↵ pastes into the previous app; ⌥↵ pastes without closing the palette
- A copy from an excluded app (Settings ▸ Clipboard ▸ Disabled Applications) is **not** recorded
- Password-manager copies are still not recorded

### Launcher and icons

- Every installed app appears; Settings panes appear under System Settings; running apps show the dot
- Icons render with no placeholder flash on reopen, and Settings ▸ Applications scrolls without hitching
- An app removed since the last open drops out after a reopen
- Learned ranking still surfaces your habitual result for a short query

### Hotkeys

- The palette, clipboard, emoji, File Search, and all three Notes shortcuts fire; a per-app shortcut
  toggles that app
- Recording captures a shortcut, and the old binding does not fire while recording
- A conflicting binding is rejected and names its current owner
- A double-tap binding fires; Hyper Key remaps and its status dot is green
- Every binding survives quit and relaunch

### Uninstall

- The launcher's Uninstall action opens the scan screen; the bundle is first, leftovers sorted by path
- Rows appear with no loading copy at any point; folder sizes fill in behind them and totals climb
- Locked rows cannot be checked; filtering by name works
- Confirming moves items to the Trash and they are **recoverable from it**
- Escaping mid-scan cancels promptly with no spinner left behind
- Hiding and immediately restoring the screen never strands an in-flight file icon as a placeholder

### Quicklinks

- A quicklink opens its destination; `{argument}` prompts in order and Backspace steps back
- `{selection}` falls back per the Settings choice
- Pin, duplicate, delete and Open with Default all behave; import and export round-trip
- Display order is pinned first by pin time, then by name

### File Search

- With File Search **off**: Search Files is absent, its shortcut no-ops, and no permission appears
- Enabling in Settings exposes Search Files immediately; it persists across relaunch and backup import
- Disabling during a query cancels it and returns the open screen to the launcher
- File Search and Quicklinks remain independently visible in all four enabled/disabled combinations
- An empty query performs no search; a filename query returns only files and folders beneath the scopes
- Library internals, generated trees, application bundles and hidden paths do not appear
- Visible custom top-level home folders and cloud-drive files remain searchable
- Return opens, Command-Return reveals in Finder, and Copy Path keeps the palette open with a HUD
- Replacing a query quickly never lets an older result list overwrite the current query
- A broad `.` search can be scrolled end to end; leaving it releases its fitted icons, and repeating the
  cycle does not raise the post-close memory floor
- Removing home and adding one folder narrows results to it; restoring the default brings them back
- A cleared scope list returns nothing rather than falling back to home, and never hangs
- A missing scope shows the warning triangle without failing the rest of the search
- Adding `*.log` takes effect on the next query with no relaunch; removing it restores those results
- Built-in ignore rows carry no remove button; user rows do, and a duplicate or blank is refused
- Recording a shortcut opens the palette straight into File Search, hidden from the launcher or not
- The pane's checkbox and the Search Files row in Settings ▸ Commands move together
- Export, clear both lists and the shortcut, re-import: all three return, defaults undo not duplicated

### Notes

- With Notes **off**: all three commands are absent, their shortcuts no-op, and the Notes directory is
  not created
- Enabling in Settings projects Show Notes, Create Note, and Search Notes immediately; the pane's
  visibility checkboxes and recorders match Settings > Commands
- Show Notes opens the last active note and focuses an already visible window without hiding it
- Create Note makes one unique Untitled file, including as the first action in an empty channel
- Command-P and the Browse button focus search, arrows move selection, Return opens, and Command-N
  creates
- Empty switcher search reads the complete recent list; title and body searches rank correctly and a
  superseded query never publishes
- Inline rename updates the Markdown filename without changing source; collisions receive a suffix
- Delete confirms through Mote, moves the file to Trash, and selecting another note never loses an
  unsaved edit
- An existing `Floating Note.md` appears as an ordinary note without conversion
- Markdown source remains completely literal: markers stay visible, links are not activated, and task
  syntax is ordinary text; there is no preview, formatting menu, or task overlay
- Return, Tab, Delete, and formatting-looking shortcuts retain native plain-text behavior
- Edit one note, switch to a shorter note, then Undo and Redo: the new note remains intact and the app
  does not terminate
- Marked-text input, emoji, combining marks, Copy, Cut, Paste, Select All, Undo, Redo, and Find preserve
  exact source
- An empty note shows `Start writing…`; the footer count is right after typing, pasting and undoing
- Traffic lights sit top-left, the title is centred **on the window**, and the capsule is top-right, all
  on one line; the yellow light is disabled and green zooms
- Each capsule button shows a hover capsule and a native tooltip, and fires its action
- Dragging the title bar moves the window and dragging an edge resizes it; both survive relaunch
- Clicking another app leaves the panel visible; Escape, Command-W, and the red light hide it
- Command-Q does nothing anywhere; with Settings in front, Command-W closes Settings
- Hiding restores the previous external app or Mote window
- Open Notes Folder opens Finder with the active Markdown file selected, or the folder with no note
- Deleting every note closes the browse list and leaves one clean empty state with no character count;
  Command-N from there creates and selects one note
- The browse list fades only at its bottom edge and rests opaque once it reaches the end
- Quitting inside the debounce window saves the last edit
- Over a light desktop, the corner matches the palette's, the shadow follows it, and no dark edge shows
  around the glass controls

### Snippets

- With snippets **off**: no launcher entries, no keyword expansion, and no permission prompt at launch
- Enabling shows the consent dialog **before** the Accessibility prompt
- Declining leaves the feature off and prompts for nothing
- After enabling, a keyword expands in a text field; an argument-bearing snippet prompts then delivers
- Editing a snippet file externally reloads it

### Calculator and currency

- `2+2` shows a card; ↵ copies and records to history; unit and date conversions work
- In Calculator History, ⌃X deletes a row and ⌃⇧X clears the history behind a confirmation
- A currency query answers from the cached snapshot; with the cache cleared and no network it reports
  rates unavailable rather than guessing
- A bare amount (`1 usd`) answers in the Mac's region currency, and follows a change to
  System Settings ▸ General ▸ Language & Region without a relaunch — and nothing prompts for location
- A crypto query (`1 btc`, `0.5 sol to eur`) answers, and `1 usd to btc` stays in plain notation

### Calendar and meetings

- With Calendar **off**: no launcher entries, no card, no permission prompt at launch
- Enabling shows the consent dialog **before** the macOS prompt; declining prompts for nothing
- With a meeting four minutes out, an empty palette shows the card on top, provider glyph and all
- The countdown steps on the minute boundary rather than on a keystroke
- ↵ joins: a Zoom link opens the Zoom app, and the browser where no app claims the scheme
- Typing a character swaps the card for the calculator's; ↑/↓ never lands on a phantom row
- Unchecking a calendar drops its events from the launcher and My Schedule, and survives a relaunch
- Adding or deleting an event in Calendar.app updates an open palette without a reopen
- A meeting with no link is listed and searchable, and answers Open in Calendar rather than Join
- Import a backup taken with Calendar on: it comes back **off**, and no calendar toggle travels
- Menu bar on Never: the item is the plain icon; on 5 minutes the title and countdown appear at T-5
  and step on the minute boundary, not on a keystroke
- `Only show events with meetings` hides a linkless event and shows it again when unchecked
- Hide Current Event on Automatically clears the entry at the start and hands the space to the next
  event inside its lead time; on 5 minutes it lingers counting up, then clears
- Clicking the menu bar item opens the menu with `Join <title>` on top — a bare click never joins
- Camera Preview on: ↵ on the join card opens the panel, ↵ joins, Esc drops the join; the camera
  light goes out with the panel, and the first run prompts once
- Auto Join on: the meeting opens itself at its start, **once** — dismiss it and it does not return.
  With confirm on and camera preview off, the dialog asks first
- Arming Auto Join during a meeting already under way joins nothing
- Sleeping over a meeting's start and waking past it reloads the events; one still inside the window
  joins, one long past does not
- Create Event writes to the default calendar and shows up on the card, the schedule and the launcher
  without a relaunch; a blank title leaves the dialog up on ↵ and on a click
- Arrow keys move the caret in the New Event title field, and still step the Set Volume slider
- Every row of Settings ▸ Calendar has Add Alias, Record Hotkey and a checkbox, and an alias set
  there is the alias the Commands pane shows
- Export with auto join and camera preview on, import onto a clean profile: both come back **off**,
  while the menu-bar settings carry over

### System actions and window management

- A confirmation-gated action (Restart, Quit All) confirms, showing the subject's own glyph
- Volume actions show the volume HUD; everything else shows the message pill
- Holding a bound hotkey does **not** stack dialogs
- Window commands move the window you were last in; cycle-on-repeat steps ½ → ⅓ → ⅔
- "Top Half" lands flush with the top of the visible frame, on a secondary display too

### Settings and backup

- Every pane renders and the sidebar switches without flicker
- A feature switch takes effect in the launcher immediately; every setting survives relaunch
- Export produces a file; import applies it and reports a sensible summary
- **`snippetsEnabled` is not in the exported file**, and importing does not enable snippets

### Clean install

The realistic storage failure is a store that crashes on an absent file rather than starting empty.
Wipe the Dev channel and check that path directly:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.mote.app.dev
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.mote.app.dev"
defaults delete com.mote.app.dev 2>/dev/null || true
tccutil reset Accessibility com.mote.app.dev 2>/dev/null || true
```

- Launches with every store directory absent — no crash, no hang; onboarding runs
- Palette opens and lists apps, System Settings panes and system actions
- **Every setting shows its intended default.** Walk the panes: this is what catches a broken
  absence-versus-`false` read
- Quit and relaunch: everything created above persisted
- Nothing was written outside `com.mote.app.dev/`. Channel isolation is not negotiable — a Dev build
  writing into the stable app's directory is a defect even though the data is disposable
