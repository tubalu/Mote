# App launcher & fuzzy match

`AppIndex.scan()` runs off-main, enumerates the user's search scopes, and dedups by bundle ID (the
earliest scope wins).

## Invariants

- **`AppEntry.Kind` is the only thing that says what an entry is.** One case per launcher section, per
  `VisibilityStore` category and per Settings pane — never re-derive a category by sniffing an entry ID.
  A new category means a new case, a slice in `AppIndex.publishEntries()`, and the matching filter in
  `LauncherList.rows`, in that order.
- **`Model/SearchRelevance.swift` is Foundation-only and pure**, so `fuzz-test` compiles the shipped
  scorer. It owns both `FuzzyMatch` and the field bands.
- **Searchable fields stay separate** — display name, Spotlight alternate names, bundle id and executable
  name are never flattened into one string, because the field is what picks the band. A new searchable
  field means a new `Band` case and a `consider` call, in priority order.
- **`Model/SearchScopes.swift` and `Model/LauncherRankingStore.swift` are pure too** — the ranking store
  takes its clock via `now` and its path via `fileURL`, for `scopes-test` and `ranking-test`.

## Search scopes

`SearchScopes` (`Launcher/Model/SearchScopes.swift`) owns the paths; the list is user-editable in General
Settings and persisted as `AppSettings.searchScopes`. A scope is either a directory or a single `.app`
bundle, stored tilde-abbreviated so the UI reads cleanly and a settings backup stays portable.

Enumeration descends **one subfolder deep** — a scope's own `.app` children, plus any inside an
immediate subfolder, are indexed. That catches vendor-folder installs like
`/Applications/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve.app` without the folder needing its own scope
(#256). The walk stays bounded rather than fully recursive: it never opens an `.app` bundle's own
`Contents/` tree, because `.app` is treated as a leaf, and a subfolder nested deeper than one level
still needs its own scope.

The defaults cover `/Applications` and `/System/Applications` plus their `Utilities` folders,
`/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications`, the cryptex apps under
`/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/App/System/Applications` (this is the only place Safari really
lives — `/Applications/Safari.app` is a symlink flagged hidden, so `.skipsHiddenFiles` never sees it),
`~/Applications`, and `/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app`.

Finder ships as an individual bundle scope rather than by adding `/System/Library/CoreServices`, which
holds ~120 background-agent bundles. There is no reliable way to filter those: `LSUIElement`,
`LSBackgroundOnly` and "declares no icon" each also exclude legitimately launchable apps — Raycast,
Stats, Tinycast itself, Mission Control, Siri, Time Machine, Screenshot, System Information, Font
Book. Don't reintroduce such a heuristic.

`AppIndex.start(settings:)` observes `$searchScopes`, so an edit re-indexes immediately; overlapping
refreshes collapse into a single trailing scan.

`FuzzyMatch.score` is a tiered scorer: exact → prefix → substring / word-start → subsequence with
consecutive / word-boundary bonuses. `LauncherRankingStore` then adds a bounded, query-specific
frecency boost (frequency plus decaying recency). The boost can reorder results within a relevance
tier but cannot make a weaker match kind beat a stronger one. Matching strips invisible Unicode
format scalars first, since app metadata can contain bidi/zero-width markers before the visible name.

## Searchable fields

An app is matched on five fields kept deliberately separate — flattening them into one string would
lose the thing that decides the ranking. `SearchRelevance.score` evaluates each independently and the
strongest one becomes the entry's base relevance:

| Band | Field                                   | Match strength                                    |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 6    | user alias (any entry kind)             | anchored literal — exact / prefix                 |
| 5    | display name (plus a snippet's keyword) | literal — exact / prefix / word-start / substring |
| 4    | Spotlight alternate names, plus a user alias's word-start / substring hits | literal |
| 3    | display name                            | subsequence                                       |
| 2    | Spotlight alternate names               | subsequence                                       |
| 1    | bundle identifier                       | literal only                                      |
| 0    | executable name (`CFBundleExecutable`)  | literal only                                      |

The arithmetic is what makes that table binding. A band's offset is `rawValue * bandStride`, and:

```
bandStride            = 10 × FuzzyMatch.maximumScore   = 1,000,000
FuzzyMatch.maximumScore                                =   100,000
LauncherRankingStore.maximumBoost                      =     4,500
```

So a field can never reach the band above it — the widest possible fuzzy score is a tenth of a stride —
and the learned frecency boost is two orders of magnitude below a stride, which is what keeps learning
reordering *within* a tier and never across one. Those three numbers are a contract, not a tuning
parameter.

A _literal_ hit on a weaker field outranks a _subsequence_ hit on a stronger one. That is the point of
the split: an alias the vendor actually declared (`Codex` for ChatGPT) must beat the incidental
c-o-d-e…x scattered through an unrelated app's name, while a real prefix hit on a display name still
wins outright.

Identifier fields never subsequence-match — reverse-DNS text is a subsequence of nearly every short
query (`cop` ⊂ `com.apple.Photos`), which would change _which_ apps appear rather than just their
order. For the same reason a bundle id is matched with its leading component stripped
(`apple.Photos`, not `com.apple.Photos`): `com` alone prefixes almost every installed app. The full id
still matches exactly, so a pasted identifier resolves.

### Category search

A query that *equals* a category's own name lists that whole category under its section header, in the
order the section shows when the field is empty. Both words a kind already carries work — the section
title and the singular label — read straight
off `KindDescriptor` by `AppEntry.Kind.named(by:)`, so no category name is written a second time and a
new `Kind` case gets its category word for free.

**The trigger is exact equality, never a prefix or a fuzzy hit**, because a looser rule would take a word
away from a real entry: `System Settings` names both a category and an installed application. That one
collision is answered rather than avoided — an entry whose display name equals the query joins the
listing, so the app appears under Applications above the panes. Since slice order is section order
(`publishEntries`), `categoryListing` is a filter with no sort, and the sectioned view stays 1:1 with the
flat selection. Visibility still applies downstream, and no `limit` does, matching the empty query.

`LauncherScreen` therefore separates the two jobs the empty query used to do at once: `showSections`
draws the headers, `pinsFavorites` pins the Favorites prefix and hands out the ⌘-digit slots. A category
listing takes the first only. Opening a row from one also records nothing in `LauncherRankingStore` — a
category word is not a search for the row that ran, and learning it would rank that row under `s`.

### User aliases

`AliasStore` (`Launcher/Service/`) keeps one user-chosen alias per entry, keyed by `preferenceKey`
like favorites and learned ranking, so every entry kind — apps, commands, quicklinks, snippets —
can carry one. An alias is deliberate in a way no vendor field is, so a hit **from its start** —
exact or prefix — occupies the top band and ranks its entry first. A hit *inside* the alias ranks
with the Spotlight aliases instead (`term` inside `iterm` must not beat Terminal's own prefix),
and a subsequence of a short alias would be noise, so it never matches at all. `AppIndex` folds the
alias into `SearchFields.userAlias` at rank time, keying its memos on the store's revision.

A launcher row shows its entry's alias as a small chip after the name, so what a badge-bearing
result will answer to is visible without opening anything.

Editing lives in Settings only — an alias is one-time configuration like a shortcut or a
visibility checkbox, not a per-invocation action, so the ⌘K menu stays out of it. Every pane built
on `LauncherItemsSection` puts an `AliasField` on each row, dressed like the `ShortcutRecorder`
beside it; edits store as typed and trim when the field loses focus, and a blank means none. That
list filters by **membership only**, keeping the index's name order — re-ranking it per keystroke
would move the row being edited out from under its own field editor.

Aliases ride along in a settings backup (`launcherAliases`), and deleting what an alias points at —
uninstalling an app, deleting a quicklink or custom command, uninstalling an extension — removes it
with the entry's other per-entry preferences.

### Alternate names

`SpotlightNames` reads `kMDItemAlternateNames` — the aliases macOS itself knows an app by, which no
Info.plist key exposes: `iBooks` for Books, `iCal` for Calendar, `Address Book` for Contacts,
`System Preferences` for System Settings, `browser` / `浏览器` / `사파리` for Safari. `MDItem.h` exports
no constant for the attribute, so it is named directly.

Spotlight mixes junk in with the real aliases, and `SearchFields.usableAlternateNames` (pure, covered
by the harness) drops it: every bundle lists its own `<Name>.app` file name, several system apps ship
untranslated `ALTERNATE_NAME_1` placeholders, and some just repeat the display name. Indexing those
would make `app` match the entire index.

A Spotlight round trip costs ~0.8 ms per bundle cold — 76 ms over the default scopes — and the scan
reruns on every launcher open, so `SpotlightNames.Cache` memoizes per bundle path and re-reads only
when the bundle's modification date moves, taking later passes to ~0.2 ms. Each pass is seeded from
the last and keeps only what it looked at, so uninstalled apps fall out instead of accumulating.
`.appex` Settings panes carry no alternate names, so `SettingsPaneScanner` doesn't ask.

Selecting a launcher result records every prefix of the submitted query, so choosing WhatsApp for
`wha` also teaches `w` and `wh`. Direct hotkeys and empty-query favorites do not affect learned
ranking. Learned data stays on device in `launcher-ranking.json`; a result that has learned ranking
offers a per-item reset in its Actions menu, and users can clear all learned ranking in General
Settings.

Rankings are memoized one query deep and keyed by the ranking store's revision, so a launch or reset
invalidates the cached order. `rank` resolves the whole learned table for a query up front via
`boosts(query:)` — one fold and one clock read per pass, not per candidate.

## System actions

`SystemActionCatalog` is a Foundation-only inventory of the macOS actions Tinycast exposes. Its
stable entry IDs, labels, symbols and confirmation policy are covered by
`Tests/system-action-test.swift`; platform side effects live separately in `SystemActionRunner`.
`SystemActionCoordinator.runSystemAction(id:)` remains the one execution funnel — shared by palette activation and a
global hotkey — hiding the floating palette before any confirmation or value dialog and surfacing
permission-aware failures. With the palette closed it targets the frontmost app, so Hide Others and
Quit All act on the same window a palette launch would have.

System actions occupy their own launcher section and their own Settings pane. The empty-query publication
order is applications, System Settings, system actions, then built-in commands; the sectioned view
filters in that same order so the visible rows remain identical to the flat selection index.
Search, favorites, visibility and learned ranking work through the normal `AppEntry` path, and every
action is bindable to a global shortcut from Settings › System Actions
(see [hotkeys.md](hotkeys.md)).

Public AppKit, CoreAudio and workspace APIs are preferred. Actions without a stable public macOS API
use fixed system tools, Apple Events, Accessibility, or a dynamically resolved Bluetooth power API.
Those routes run only on explicit activation. Automation, Accessibility or Bluetooth permission is
requested at first use, and denial produces an alert linking to the relevant System Settings pane.
Toggle System Appearance changes macOS; Tinycast follows it only while its own Appearance is System.

Restart, Shut Down, Log Out, Empty Trash and Quit All Applications confirm before execution: ↵ runs
the action, Escape cancels. Every dialog is Tinycast's own: confirmations, failure reports and the Set
Volume slider all render through `DialogController` rather than an `NSAlert`
(see [ui.md](../ui.md#dialogs--hud)). Each confirmation carries the action's own icon — Restart shows
`arrow.clockwise`, Empty Trash `trash.slash` — so the dialog is recognizably about the row that
opened it. Volume and mute actions also show Tinycast's transient volume HUD, since macOS only draws
its own for real media keys. Volume Up/Down walk a 5% grid (`VolumeLevel.stepped`, covered by
`Tests/volume-test.swift`): an off-grid level snaps to the next line rather than past it, so from 37%
up lands on 40% and down on 35%, and repeated presses stay on round numbers.

An action whose effect is invisible reports back through a pill (`MessageHUDController`) rather than
finishing silently:
`SystemActionRunner.run` returns a `SystemActionFeedback` naming the state it landed in
(`Trash Emptied`, `Hidden Files Shown`, `Dark Appearance`, `Bluetooth Off`, `3 Disks Ejected`), and
`AppCore` shows it with a `DialogTone` derived from the feedback's `isNoOp` flag: `.success` when
something actually changed, `.neutral` when there was nothing to do, shown as the glyph trailing the
message rather than a per-action icon, since the message already names the state. Actions that are
their own confirmation, such as Show Desktop, Hide Others,
Quit All and the power actions, return nothing. Volume and mute are the one case that stays on the
palette's own box HUD, since that one has an actual level and number to show, not just a message.

**Nothing-to-do is an outcome, not a failure.** Empty Trash asks Finder for `count items of trash`
first and reports `Trash Is Already Empty`, because Finder raises an error when told to empty an empty
Trash. The count deliberately goes through Finder instead of reading `~/.Trash` directly: that folder
is TCC-protected, so an unprivileged read fails in a way indistinguishable from "empty", which would
silently skip a real empty. Eject All Disks, Dismiss Notifications and Unhide All Apps report the same
way when there is nothing to act on. Volume and mute fall back to the output's preferred stereo channels when the device exposes
no master element (common on HDMI), and Toggle Mute parks the level at zero when there is no mute
control at all. Multi-disk ejection excludes internal and network volumes, treats a sibling volume
that the same physical eject already unmounted as done, and reports remaining failures together.
Preference-backed toggles refuse to write when the current value can't be read, and notification
dismissal matches Accessibility subroles rather than English labels.

The ranking harness covers prefix learning, frequency/recency scoring, persistence, and both reset
paths; see the command in `development.md`.

Launcher icons use a persistent 32 MB cost-capped `NSCache`. Fitted file-row icons use a separate
transient 8 MB cache that is purged when its palette list disappears (`IconCache`).

## Favorites

`FavoritesStore.keys` is the order — the array *is* the ranking, and it only shows while the query is
empty, where `AppIndex.orderedResults` pins it as a prefix of the results. `LauncherScreen` resolves
that prefix once in `init` (`favoriteCount`), and the list, the reorder rows and the chord guards all
read that one number, so the visible section and what a move acts on can't disagree.

The ⌘K menu carries **Add / Remove from Favorites** (⇧⌘F) plus **Move Favorite Up / Down** (⌥⌘↑ /
⌥⌘↓). A move row is only built in a direction that exists, so the first favorite has no Up row and
the last has no Down.

**Every one of those rows runs the same call its chord does** — the menu is handed an
`AppActionsMenu.FavoriteActions` built by `LauncherScreen` and never touches `FavoritesStore` itself.
A row that mutates the store directly looks identical on screen and then behaves differently from its
chord, because the store knows nothing about where the highlight should land.

`FavoritesStore.exchange` swaps two stored positions rather than removing and re-inserting. `keys`
retains entries that `VisibilityStore` hides or that aren't currently indexed — `ordered(_:)` drops
them with `compactMap` and never prunes them, which is how a favorite survives an unmounted volume —
so exchanging the two *visible* keys leaves every such key on its own slot.

Both actions re-ask `orderedResults` afterwards and restate `vm.selection` against it; the mutation
already invalidated the memo, so that call warms the exact key the next render reads. Where the
highlight lands differs on purpose: a **move** follows the entry, since the point of the action is
where that entry now sits, while a **toggle** stays with the section rather than chasing an entry
across the list — the top of Favorites on add, the neighbour above the one that left on remove.

### ⌘-digit slots

`FavoriteSlots` (`Launcher/Model/FavoriteSlots.swift`) defines ten local palette slots: **⌘1…⌘9 then
⌘0**. They match the physical number row, not the character produced by the current keyboard layout,
so the same positions work on QWERTY and AZERTY. The eleventh favorite is still listed and reorderable,
and simply has no slot.

Both palette sizes serve the chords from the same prefix, because `paletteIsCollapsed` already
requires an empty query: **compact implies empty implies `favoriteCount` is the pinned prefix**. That
is why `LauncherScreen.pinnedFavorites` feeds the strip, the chords and the numbered rows alike,
rather than the compact bar re-deriving an empty-query order of its own. In compact the strip draws
the first five; ⌘6–⌘0 still launch favorites it has no room for, and the "…" is a button after them
rather than a slot, so no favorite loses its digit to the overflow.

Holding ⌘ swaps each numbered row's kind label for its chord. `PalettePanel` publishes the modifier
into `PaletteState.commandHeld` from `.flagsChanged` and clears it in `resignKey` — not in `prepare`,
which a re-show that preserves state skips entirely. **`AppRow` observes that flag itself**: reading
it any higher would attach it to `RootPaletteView`'s body and rebuild the whole palette on every ⌘
press, where a row-level read re-runs only the handful of rows the `LazyVStack` has realized. The
digit each row shows is carried on its `Row` case from the section build, so no row searches for its
own position.

## Reveal in Finder

Application and System Settings results expose **Show in Finder** in their ⌘K Actions menu and on
**⌘↵**. Synthetic command results have no filesystem location, so neither the menu row nor the
shortcut is available for them. `AppEntry.canRevealInFinder` is the one rule both the menu row and
the key handler read, so the advertised chord can't drift from the behavior.

## Quitting apps

`RunningAppsMonitor` (live from `NSWorkspace` launch/terminate notifications) drives both the row's
running dot and the availability of the quit actions:

- **Quit Application** — the last row of an app's ⌘K Actions menu, shown only while that app is
  running, also bound to **⌃⇧Q** on the selected row. The chord guard mirrors the menu row's
  condition (an `.application` entry that `RunningAppsMonitor` reports running) so the key never
  swallows a press it won't act on, and it's skipped in the compact bar, which shows no selection.
  `AppLauncher.quit(bundleID:)` terminates every instance of the bundle and reports whether
  anything was running; the palette only dismisses when something was, and it restores focus unless
  the app it just quit _was_ `previousApp`.
- **Quit All Applications** a system action. `AppLauncher.quitAllTargets()` is the
  policy (every `.regular` app except Finder — `terminate()` only relaunches it — and Tinycast,
  excluded by PID because About/Settings temporarily flips it to `.regular`). `SystemActionCoordinator.quitAllApps()`
  resolves that list **once**, confirms it with `DialogController`, then terminates exactly what was
  confirmed. The palette hides before the dialog — it is a floating panel and would sit above it.

Both quits are graceful `NSRunningApplication.terminate()`, so an app with unsaved work still puts up
its own save sheet.

The ⌘K menu samples `isRunning` **once, when it opens** (`RootPaletteView.openActions()`), so an app
launching or quitting elsewhere can't add or drop the Quit row while the menu is up — the same freeze
the rest of the menu already has ([palette.md](palette.md)). Only `LauncherList` observes
`RunningAppsMonitor` live, for the running dot.
