# Development

The local loop: set up, build, run, regenerate. Shipping a build is [release.md](release.md);
verifying a change is [testing.md](testing.md).

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later (Liquid Glass).
- Xcode 26 — it provides the SwiftUI macro plugin and the SDK.
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), and for linting:
  `brew install swiftlint`.

## First-time setup

Create the `Mote Self-Signed` code-signing identity once — builds sign with it, which is what keeps
macOS from forgetting the Accessibility grant on every rebuild. Follow **[signing.md](signing.md) §1**,
a few `openssl`/`security` commands.

That is the whole required setup. Editor configuration is personal and the repo does not prescribe it;
the section below is a note for anyone who wants it, not a step.

## Build & run

```sh
make install   # leftover manual steps only; brew-installs xcodegen
make           # Debug build → Mote Dev
make run       # build and launch
```

The Makefile sets `DEVELOPER_DIR` to Xcode when `/Applications/Xcode.app` exists, so Command Line
Tools being active does not break the build.

`Mote.xcodeproj` is committed and generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen — `make` regenerates
it; after changing `project.yml` commit both. There is no `Package.swift`, and `Bundle.module` must
never be used.

### The dev channel

Debug builds are a separate channel: **`Mote Dev.app`**, bundle id `com.mote.app.dev`. Every
persisted thing is keyed by bundle id — `~/Library/Preferences/<id>.plist` (settings and hotkey
bindings), `~/Library/Caches/<id>/` (launcher ranking), `~/Library/Application Support/<id>/` (the onboarding marker), the
`SMAppService` login item, and the Accessibility / Input Monitoring (TCC) grants — so a local build can
neither read nor clobber an installed app's state, and both run side by side.

Consequences worth knowing:

- The dev build asks for Accessibility on its own the first time, and starts with **no** hotkeys bound
  and onboarding unseen. Grant and bind once; it persists across rebuilds, because the fixed build path
  and the `Mote Self-Signed` identity keep the TCC grant alive.
- Don't bind the same global hotkey in both — whichever registered first wins.
- The Hyper Key's Caps Lock remap is `hidutil` state, which is **system-wide, not per-bundle**: quitting
  one build clears the remap for the other, which then needs a rebind or a relaunch to restore it.

## Editor

Xcode works out of the box and needs nothing here. Everything below is optional, and which editor you
use is your business — the repo prescribes none of it.

VS Code gets code intelligence from SourceKit-LSP, which needs a `buildServer.json` because there is no
`Package.swift`. Build once, then hand the log to the sync script — that writes both `buildServer.json`
and the flag database:

```sh
brew install xcode-build-server
xcodebuild -project Mote.xcodeproj -scheme Mote -configuration Debug \
    -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/mote-build.log
./Scripts/sync-lsp.sh /tmp/mote-build.log
```

Both files are git-ignored because they embed absolute paths, and `sourcekit-lsp` looks for
`buildServer.json` at the workspace root by name, so it cannot live in a subfolder. After this the
**Build Mote.app (debug)** task (⌘⇧B) and **F5** re-run the script on every build, so new and
renamed files keep resolving.

**Do not run `xcode-build-server config`.** It writes `kind: xcode`, and in that mode the server ignores
`.compile` entirely — it serves flags from a cache it scrapes out of `.xcactivitylog` instead. That
cache is only refreshed when `LogStoreManifest.plist` advances, and when the manifest stops updating
(it does) the editor silently pins itself to the source list from some older build: every reference to a
file added since reads *cannot find type X in scope*, in every file, until you restart the server. It
also mixes Release entries in with Debug and lets them win. `Scripts/sync-lsp.sh` keeps the mode
`manual`, where `.compile` is the single source of truth.

### Symbols in `Tests/`

`xcodebuild` never compiles the harnesses — they are not in the Xcode project — so nothing emits a
compile command for them, and without one an open harness reports every shipped type it uses as *cannot
find in scope*. Measured on `fuzz-test.swift`: 60 errors with no entry, 0 with one.

```sh
./Scripts/run-tests.sh --index    # merge the harness compile commands into .compile
```

It reads the source lists from `run-tests.sh` itself, so they cannot drift from what the suite actually
compiles. `Scripts/sync-lsp.sh` runs it too. Three things it has to get right, all of which fail
silently otherwise: every path is absolute, because `sourcekit-lsp` resolves the command itself and does
not apply `directory` to relative arguments; the command carries an explicit `-sdk`; and each entry
claims **only its own harness** in `files`. The command still lists every shipped source it compiles, so
symbols resolve inside the harness — but claiming those sources too would hand them this three-file
command instead of the app's, and `.compile` is last-wins.

Re-run it after adding a harness, then **Swift: Restart LSP Server** from the Command Palette — an
already-running server does not re-read `.compile`.

## Linting

```sh
./Scripts/lint.sh          # lint the whole project
./Scripts/lint.sh --fix    # auto-correct the mechanical subset first
```

[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) is the only code-quality tool here. `.swiftlint.yml` at
the repo root excludes the generated files and the two off-limits files in `DesignSystem/Scrolling/`.
The comment policy in [standards.md](standards.md#comments) is deliberately not among its rules.

## Formatting

```sh
./Scripts/format.sh            # format Mote/ and Tests/ in place
./Scripts/format.sh --check    # report what would change, write nothing (exit 1 if any)
```

`swift-format` from the Xcode toolchain — the same binary sourcekit-lsp formats with, so ⌘S in VS Code
and this script cannot disagree. `.swift-format` at the repo root tunes it to this tree; without it the
stock config defaults to 2-space indent and rewrites all 200 files.

Both `*.generated.swift` files are excluded: formatting one is hand-editing it, and the next
swift-format also refuses any file that does not parse, so
a failure from either command is a syntax error rather than a tooling problem — and it is why ⌘S looks
like it does nothing while a file is mid-edit with unbalanced braces.

**Think twice before leaning on this.** A formatter was rejected here on measured evidence, and that
stands: running it over the tree touched 68 files, and 67 of those changed more than whitespace.

The config sticks to rules that catch defects and stays quiet about style, because **there is no
formatter**, on measured evidence. Formatting is
Xcode's re-indent (⌃I), as it always has been. Two consequences worth knowing:

- `empty_count` is **disabled**, and `isEmpty`-style rewrites are unsafe here generally:
  `LauncherRankingRecord` and `PaletteRowIndex` have a `count` that is a hit count, not a collection
  count. A rule that rewrites `count > 0` to `!isEmpty` on them does not compile.
- `force_try` is an error; `force_cast` only warns, because the AX and AppKit bridges have four
  legitimate ones.

Errors block, warnings do not. CI runs this same script on every PR and annotates the diff with each
violation — see [release.md](release.md#continuous-integration) — so run it locally first rather than
finding out from a review.
